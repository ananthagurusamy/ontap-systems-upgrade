Before converting AFF A250 node1 to a drive shelf, you migrate the data aggregates, epsilon, and logical interfaces (LIFs) on node1 to AFF A400 node4.

.Steps
. At the LOADER prompt for node4, boot the node into the boot menu:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
. Select option `6 Update flash from backup config` to restore the /var file system to node4.
+
This replaces all flash-based configuration with the last backup to disks. 
. Enter `y` to continue.
+
[NOTE]
====
The node automatically reboots to load the new copy of the /var file system. 

The node reports a system ID mismatch warning. Enter `y` to override the system ID.
====

. Migrate the cluster LIFs:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
+
`network port show`
+
[NOTE]
====
If the system cluster ports are not similar when upgrading an AFF A250 to an AFF A400, you might have to temporarily change the interfaces on node4 into cluster ports:

`network port modify -node _node4_ -port _port_name_ -mtu 9000 -ipspace Cluster`
====
+
`network interface migrate -vserver Cluster -lif _cluster_LIF_  -destination-node _node4_ -destination-port _port_name_`
 
. Wait for the cluster to come into quorum and then verify that the cluster nodes are healthy:
+
`– cluster show`
+
NOTE: The HA pair and storage failover remain disabled in the current state.  

. Move the cluster LIFs to the temporary 25G cluster ports on node4:
+
`network interface modify`

. If interface groups and data VLANs are in use on the AFF A250 cluster you are upgrading, perform this step. If not, go to <<migrate_node1_nod4,Step 8>>.
+
The physical network port names differ between AFF A250 and AFF A400 systems. As a result, there might be incorrectly configured interface groups and displaced VLANs on node4. Check, and if required, fix any incorrectly configured interface groups and displaced VLANs.

. Migrate the data aggregates on node1 to node4:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -aggregate-list _aggregate_list_name_ -node _node1_ -destination _node4_ -ndo-controller-upgrade true -override-destination-checks true`   
. Display the status of all data aggregates in the cluster:
+
`storage aggregate show` 
. Migrate the epsilon by removing if from node1 and instead moving it to node4.
.. Remove epsilon from node1: 
+
`cluster modify -epsilon false -node _node1_`
.. Move epsilon to node4: 
+
`cluster modify -epsilon true -node _node4_`

. Display the cluster status:
+
`cluster show` 
. Display all data network LIFs:
+
`network interface show -role data` 
. Migrate all data LIFs to node4:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -destination-node _node4_ -destination-port _port_name_`
. Display the status of all data LIFs in the cluster:
+
`network interface show -role data`
. If any LIFs are down, set the administrative status of the LIFs to `up` by entering the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -status-admin up`
. Migrate the cluster management LIF:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif cluster_mgmt -destination-node _node4_ -destination-port _port_name_`
+  
. Display the status of the cluster management LIF:
+
`network interface show cluster_mgmt` 
. Halt node1: 
+
`halt -node _node1_ -inhibit-takeover true -ignore-quorum-warnings true`
