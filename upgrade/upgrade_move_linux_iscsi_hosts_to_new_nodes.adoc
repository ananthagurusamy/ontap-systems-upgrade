[.lead]
Before moving iSCSI SAN volumes to new nodes, you must create new iSCSI connections and rescan the iSCSI paths to the new nodes. 

If you do not need to move iSCSI SAN volumes when upgrading by moving volumes, you can skip this procedure and go to link:upgrade-create-aggregate-move-volumes.html[Create an aggregate and move volumes to the new nodes].

.About this task
* IPv4 interfaces are created when you set up the new iSCSI connections.
* The host commands and examples are specific to Linux operating systems.
