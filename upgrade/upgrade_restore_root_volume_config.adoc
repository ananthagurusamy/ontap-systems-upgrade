You must restore configuration information from the root volume to the boot devices.

NOTE: If you are performing an in-place controller upgrade to a system that uses ports "e0a" and "e0b" as high availability (HA) interconnect ports, for example, a FAS8300, an AFF A400, or a FAS8700, verify that you have xref:upgrade-prepare-when-moving-storage.html#assign_lifs[reassigned any management or intercluster LIFs] configured on ports "e0a" and "e0b" on the original system before starting the upgrade procedure.

Upgrading controller hardware by moving storage
This will replace all flash-based configuration with the last backup to disks. Are you sure you want to continue?: y
----
+
The update flash process runs for several minutes, and then the system reboots.
. When you are prompted to confirm the system ID mismatch, enter `y`.

WARNING: System id mismatch. This usually occurs when replacing CF or NVRAM cards!

The startup sequence proceeds normally.

If the controller upgrade fails and reports a `rlib_port_ipspace_assign` error message, you must revert the upgrade and delete the LIFs on the network ports on the original system that are being used as HA ports on the replacement system.
