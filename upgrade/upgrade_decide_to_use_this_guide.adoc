This content describes how to upgrade the controller hardware of an AFF, FAS, or ASA system in a cluster by moving storage or volumes.

Use this procedure if you want to upgrade controller hardware in the following situations:

NOTE: The hardware upgrade procedures have been simplified in ONTAP 9.8 with the introduction of the automatic port placement feature.

* Your original and new nodes are compatible and supported.
* The original and new nodes are running ONTAP 9.0 or later. NetApp recommends, when possible, that you have the same ONTAP version running on the original and new nodes.
+
If your controller upgrade includes mixed ONTAP versions, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/concept_mixed_version_requirements.html[Mixed version ONTAP clusters^] for more information.
* You are reusing the IP addresses, network masks, and gateways of the original nodes on the new nodes.
* You plan to upgrade controller hardware by moving storage or moving volumes.
* You are prepared to perform a disruptive procedure if you are upgrading by moving storage.
+
Upgrading by moving volumes is nondisruptive.

* You plan to convert a node of a supported model to a disk shelf, and then attach it to the new nodes.


If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Upgrade, refresh, or expand the MetroCluster configuration^].
