[.lead]
To complete the upgrade, you connect node3 to node4 and then migrate the data logical interfaces (LIFs) and data aggregates on node4 to node3.

.Steps
. At the LOADER prompt for node3, boot the node into the boot menu:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
. Select option `6 Update flash from backup config` to restore the /var file system to node3.
+
This replaces all flash-based configuration with the last backup to disks. 
. Enter `y` to continue.
. Allow the node to boot as normal.
+
[NOTE]
====
The node automatically reboots to load the new copy of the /var file system.

The node reports a warning that there is a system ID mismatch. Enter `y` to override the system ID.
====

. Connect node3 to node4:
.. Attach multipath high availability (MPHA) cables to the NS224 shelf to ensure redundancy. Connect node3 100GbE port e0d to NSM B port e0b and connect node4 100GbE port e0d to NSM A port e0a.
.. Verify that HA ports e0a and e0b are connected between the nodes.
.. Verify that cluster ports e3a and e3b are connected between the nodes.

. Migrate the cluster LIFs:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
+
`network port show`
. Modify the cluster broadcast domain to include the desired cluster ports:
+
`network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -broadcast-domain _broadcast_domain_name_ -ports _port_names_`
+
`network port broadcast-domain add-ports -broadcast-domain Cluster -ports _port_names_`
+
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, new IPspaces and one or more broadcast domains might be designated to existing physical ports that are intended for cluster connectivity.
. Modify the cluster IPspace to include the desired cluster ports and set the maximum transmission unit to 9000 if not already set:
+
`network port modify -node _node_name_ -port _port_name_ -mtu 9000 -ipspace Cluster`
. Display all cluster network LIFs:
+
`network interface show -role cluster` 
. Migrate all cluster network LIFs on both nodes to their home ports:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -destination-node _node_name_ -destination-port _port_name_`

. Display all cluster network LIFs:
+
`network interface show -role cluster`
. Verify the home ports for the cluster network LIFs:
+
`network interface modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -home-port _port_name_`


. Migrate all data LIFs to node3:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -destination-node _node_name_ -destination-port _port_name_`

. Display all data network LIFs:
+
`network interface show -role data`
. Configure the home node and home port for all data LIFs. If any LIFs are down, set the administrative status of the LIFs to `up` by entering the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif lif_name -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_name_ -status-admin up`
. Migrate the cluster management LIF:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif cluster_mgmt -destination-node _node3_ -destination-port _port_name_`

. Display the status of the cluster management LIF:
+
`network interface show cluster_mgmt`
. Display the status of all data aggregates in the cluster:
+
`storage aggregate show`
. Enable the HA pair, storage failover, and auto-giveback: 
+
`cluster ha modify -configured true`
. Migrate data aggregates owned by node4 to node3:
+ 
`storage aggregate relocation start -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node4_ -destination _node3_`
. Display the status of all data aggregates in the cluster:
+
`storage aggregate show`
. Enable auto-revert of the network LIFs across the nodes:
+
`network interface modify -lif * -auto-revert true`

. Enable storage failover automatic giveback:
+
`storage failover modify -node * -auto-giveback true`

. Display the cluster status:
+
`cluster show`
. Display failover eligibility: 
+
`storage failover show`
+
NOTE: In the cluster report output, a node might incorrectly own aggregates that belong to another node. If this occurs, normalize by performing a takeover and giveback from both sides of the cluster.

. Display the status of all data aggregates in the cluster:
+
`storage aggregate show`
