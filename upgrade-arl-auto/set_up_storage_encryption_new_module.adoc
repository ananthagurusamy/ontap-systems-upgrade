If the replaced controller or the HA partner of the new controller uses Storage Encryption, you must configure the new controller module for Storage Encryption, including installing SSL certificates and setting up key management servers.

.About this task

This procedure includes steps that are performed on the new controller module. You must enter the command on the correct node.

.Steps

. Verify that the key management servers are still available, their status, and their authentication key information:
+
`security key-manager show -status`
+
`security key-manager query`

. Add the key management servers listed in the previous step to the key management server list in the new controller.
..  Add the key management server:
+
`security key-manager -add _key_management_server_ip_address_`

.. Repeat the previous step for each listed key management server. You can link up to four key management servers.
.. Verify the that the key management servers were added successfully:
+
`security key-manager show`

. On the new controller module, run the key management setup wizard to set up and install the key management servers.
+
You must install the same key management servers that are installed on the existing controller module.

.. Launch the key management server setup wizard on the new node:
+
`security key-manager setup -node _new_controller_name_`

.. Complete the steps in the wizard to configure key management servers.
. Restore authentication keys from all linked key management servers to the new node:
+
`security key-manager restore -node _new_controller_name_`
