In general, how you upgrade the controller hardware depends on the platform models of the original nodes. You upgrade either by relocating aggregates or moving volumes (both nondisruptive procedures), or by moving the storage (a disruptive procedure). If you have different ONTAP versions running on the original and new nodes, you might need to perform a software upgrade before starting the hardware upgrade.

.Systems with internal drives

Choose an upgrade procedure for a system with internal drives, which are listed below:

* FAS2620, FAS2650, FAS2720, and FAS2750 
* AFF A150, AFF A200, AFF A220, AFF A250, AFF A700s, and AFF A800
* AFF C190, AFF C250, and AFF C800
* ASA A150, ASA A250, ASA A800, and ASA AFF A220

If your system is not listed, see the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to check if it has internal drives.

.Systems with only external drives

Choose an upgrade procedure for a system with only external drives, which are listed below:

* FAS8200, FAS8300, FAS8700, FAS9000, and FAS9500
* AFF A300, AFF A320, AFF A400, AFF A700, and AFF A900 
* AFF C400 
* ASA A400, ASA A900, and ASA AFF A700

If your system is not listed, see the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to check if it only has external drives.

Learn about the controller hardware upgrade procedures:

+
Aggregate relocation is a replacement procedure. You do not need to expand and shrink your cluster with the new nodes which is beneficial for two-node switchless clusters. Moving data by relocating aggregates is faster than copying data across aggregates when moving volumes.

[NOTE]
====
*Note1*: The ONTAP version running on the original nodes must be supported by the new nodes. If required, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/prepare.html[upgrade the ONTAP version^] on the original nodes to the maximum supported version. The version difference between the original and new nodes cannot be greater than four. For example, ONTAP 9.8 and 9.12.1 is supported; however, ONTAP 9.8 and 9.13.1 is not supported. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/concept_mixed_version_requirements.html[Learn more about mixed version ONTAP clusters^].

*Note2*: A nondisruptive upgrade requires a new system with its own storage and shelves to store the data from the original system. 

*Note3*: When upgrading by moving volumes, you join the new nodes, move the volumes and LIFs to the new nodes, and then unjoin the nodes you want to remove from the cluster. If you are upgrading a two-node switchless cluster, you convert it to a switched attached cluster using a pair of cluster switches before adding new nodes.

If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Upgrade, refresh, or expand the MetroCluster configuration^].

If you are replacing an individual component, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems/index.html[AFF and FAS System Documentation^] and locate the field-replaceable unit (FRU) flyer for that component.
