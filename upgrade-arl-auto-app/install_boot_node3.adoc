a|Manually configure the connection by using the following command at the boot environment prompt:
`ifconfig e0M -addr=_filer_addr_ -mask=_netmask_ -gw=_gateway_ -dns=_dns_addr_ -domain=_dns_domain_`

`_filer_addr_` is the IP address of the storage system (mandatory).
`_netmask_` is the network mask of the storage system (mandatory).
`_gateway_` is the gateway for the storage system (mandatory).
`_dns_addr_` is the IP address of a name server on your network (optional).
`_dns_domain_` is the Domain Name Service (DNS) domain name (optional).

NOTE: Other parameters might be necessary for your interface. Enter `help ifconfig` at the firmware prompt for details.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot mix FIPS drives with other types of drives on the same node or HA pair.
You can mix SEDs with non-encrypting drives on the same node or HA pair.

If you do not have an FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration, execute link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_node4.html#auto_check_node4_step15[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4, Step 15] so that node4 can recognize node2’s disks.

. [[step29]]For a MetroCluster configuration, V-Series systems and systems with FlexArray Virtualization software connected to storage arrays,  you must set and configure the FC or UTA/UTA2 ports on node3 to detect the disks attached to the node.
To complete this task, go to section link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_on_node3.html[Set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node3].
