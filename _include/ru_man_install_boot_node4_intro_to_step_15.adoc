You must install node4 in the rack, transfer node2 connections to node4, and boot node4. You must also reassign any node2 spares, any disks belonging to root, and any non-root aggregates that were not relocated to node3 earlier.

.About this task

You must netboot node4 if it does not have the same version of ONTAP 9 that is installed on node2. After you install node4, boot it from the ONTAP 9 image stored on the web server. You can then download the correct files to the boot media device for subsequent system boots by following the instructions in link:prepare_for_netboot.html[Prepare for netboot]

However, you are not required to netboot node4 if it has the same or later version of ONTAP 9 that is installed on node2.

*Important information:*

* If you are upgrading a V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization Software that is connected to storage arrays, you need to complete <<man_install4_Step1,Step 1>> through <<man_install4_Step7,Step 7>>, leave this section at <<man_install4_Step8,Step 8>> and follow instructions in link:set_fc_uta_uta2_config_node4.html[Set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node4] as needed, entering the commands in Maintenance mode. You then need to return to this section and resume the procedure at <<man_install4_Step9,Step 9>>.

* However, if you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you must complete this entire section and then proceed to the section link:set_fc_uta_uta2_config_node4.html[Set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node4], entering commands at the cluster prompt.

.Steps

. [[man_install4_Step1]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If node4 will be in ... |Then...
|A chassis separate from node3 |Go to <<man_install4_Step2,Step 2>>.
|The same chassis with node3 |Skip Steps 2 and 3 and go to <<man_install4_Step4,Step 4>>.
|===

. [[man_install4_Step2]] Make sure that node4 has sufficient rack space.
+
If node4 is in a separate chassis from node3, you can put node4 in the same location as node2. If node3 and node4 are in the same chassis, then node4 is already in its appropriate rack location.

. Install node4 in the rack, following the instructions in the _Installation and Setup Instructions_ for the node model.

. [[man_install4_Step4]]Cable node4, moving the connections from node2 to node4.
+
The following references help you make proper cable connections. Go to link:other_references.html[References] to link to them.
+
* _Installation and Setup Instructions_ or _FlexArray Virtualization Installation Requirements and Reference_ for the node4 platform
* The appropriate disk shelf procedure
* The _High Availability management_ documentation

+
Cable the following connections:

* Console (remote management port)
* Cluster ports
* Data ports
* Cluster and node management ports
* Storage
* SAN configurations: iSCSI Ethernet and FC switch ports

+
NOTE: You do not need to move the interconnect card/FC_VI card or interconnect/FC_VI cable connection from node2 to node4 because most platform models have unique interconnect card models.

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If node4 is in... |Then...
|The same chassis as node3 |Go to <<man_install4_Step8,Step 8>>.
|A chassis separate from node3 |Go to <<man_install4_Step6,Step 6>>.
|===

. [[man_install4_Step6]]Turn on the power to node4, and then interrupt the boot by pressing `Ctrl-C` to access the boot environment prompt.
+
NOTE: When you boot node4, you might see the following message:

+
----
WARNING: The battery is unfit to retain data during a power
         outage. This is likely because the battery is
         discharged but could be due to other temporary
         conditions.
         When the battery is ready, the boot process will
         complete and services will be engaged.
         To override this delay, press 'c' followed by 'Enter'
----

. [[man_install4_Step7]]If you see the warning message in Step 6, take the following actions:
.. Check for any console messages that might indicate a problem other than a low NVRAM battery and, if necessary, take any required corrective action.
.. Allow the battery to charge and the boot process to finish.
+
WARNING: *Warning: Do not override the delay. Failure to allow the battery to charge could result in a loss of data.*

. [[man_install4_Step8]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If your system... |Then...
|Has disks and no back-end storage
|Skip Step 9 through Step 14 and go to <<man_install4_Step15,Step 15>>.
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
a|
.. Go to the section _Set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node4_ and complete the sections link:set_fc_uta_uta2_config_node4.html#configure-fc-ports-on-node4[ Configure FC ports on node4] and link:set_fc_uta_uta2_config_node4.html#check-and-configure-utauta2-ports-on-node4[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4], as appropriate to your system.
.. Return to this section and complete the remaining steps, beginning with <<man_install4_Step9,Step 9>>.

IMPORTANT: You must reconfigure FC onboard ports, UTA/UTA2 onboard ports, and UTA/UTA2 cards before you boot ONTAP on the V-Series system.
|===

. [[man_install4_Step9]]Add the FC initiator ports of the new node to the switch zones.
+
See your storage array and zoning documentation for instructions.
. Add the FC initiator ports to the storage array as new hosts, mapping the array LUNs to the new hosts.
+
See your storage array and zoning documentation for instructions.
. Modify the World Wide Port Name (WWPN) values in the host or volume groups associated with array LUNs on the storage array.
+
Installing a new controller module changes the WWPN values associated with each onboard FC port.
. If your configuration uses switch-based zoning, adjust the zoning to reflect the new WWPN values.
. Verify that the array LUNs are now visible to node4 by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`sysconfig -v`
+
The system displays all the array LUNs that are visible to each of the FC initiator ports. If the array LUNs are not visible, you cannot reassign disks from node2 to node4 later in this section.
. Press `Ctrl-C` to display the boot menu and select Maintenance mode.
. [[man_install4_Step15]]At the Maintenance mode prompt, enter the following command:
+
`halt`
+
The system stops at the boot environment prompt.
. Configure node4 for ONTAP:
+
`set-defaults`
